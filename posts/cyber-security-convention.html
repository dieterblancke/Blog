                This day started extra early as this event was located in "Mechelen".
                First I took the train to Ghent where I was waiting for Gerbaud & Dylan, but their train had some delay
                so I decided to wait for them.
                This did make us miss our train to Mechelen, but we were able to take the next train. We still had
                plenty of time because we departed extra early!
            </p>
            <p>
                This convention had many speakers / companies that were present to talk about the security topic which
                is getting more and more important. <br/>

                Firstly I went to the room with "Inty De Ceukelaire". He is a Flemish ethical hacker, pretty well known
                in the ethical hacking community.
                He talked about ethical hacking and the bounties big companies are willing to give if someones reports
                large bugs / security threats.
                Ofcourse he also talked about some of the hacks he has done and about some bug bounty platforms.
            </p>
            <p>
                Later on the day I also visited the talk of Howest lecturer Kurt Callewaert about Blockchain before we
                visited the final topic of the day presented by Tijl Deneut. <br/>
                This last talk did run a bit over time, but it was very interesting though. The rest of my group already
                had the same talk the day before, but as I didn't, it was a very interesting topic.
            </p>
            <p>
                To finish this long day, we had a quick drink before we took our trains back home.
