                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    Due to the COVID-19 virus, I couldn't attend the events that I planned to go to anymore.
                    So me, Tijl & Dylan decided to work on a Quiz app called QuizIT!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We started by talking about what kind of quiz app we wanted and how we wanted to code it.
                    Aswell as making some database schemas / migrations and making default quizzes. <br/>
                    We ended up choosing for a Quiz App. Mostly me and Tijl have done development while Dylan made some
                    schemas, wireframes & the default quizzes.
                </p>

                <h3>Development</h3>

                <p>
                    We decided to choose Laravel for the Quiz web app because it's an easy and straightforward framework
                    and me + Tijl know how this framework works.
                    For local development and testing, I have decided to use Homestead which is a VM that has most of
                    the Laravel requirements setup by default.

                </p>

                <article>
                    <h4>User Dashboard</h4>
                    <p>
                        We started with the development of the user dashboard of the quiz site. <br/>
                        In this dashboard, we wanted at least the following functionalities:
                    </p>
                    <ol style="list-style: decimal; padding-left: 1rem;">
                        <li>People can login & register</li>
                        <li>People can create a quiz</li>
                        <li>People can edit a quiz</li>
                        <li>People can delete a quiz</li>
                        <li>People can (de)activate a quiz</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        On the first day, we spent quite some time brainstorming and troubleshooting with some issues
                        that
                        popped up. <br/>
                        We still managed to get quite some coding done, and after day two, we finished the first version
                        of the user panel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Later during development we found some things that were lacking in the user dashboard that made
                        it confusing.
                        As a solution, we added a "Caption" section with explanation of what icons do what. <br/>

                        We also added a way for the quiz creator to see who has finished their quiz and what result they
                        had doing so.
                    </p>

                <article>
                    <h4>Playground development</h4>

                    <p>
                        Once the user dashboard was finished, we could start on the user dashboard.
                        Due to us having issues with web sockets not working as they were supposed to, we decided to go
                        with a more "test like" quiz setup.

                        We decided to use short string identifiers (8 characters) as keys that people can use to join a
                        quiz.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the loading screen, we decided to add some fun jokes so people can have a laugh before they
                        start their quiz!
                        After a few seconds, you can just fill in all the answers and submit the quiz.
                        After that you get sent to a results page where you can see your score and which answers you got
                        right or wrong.
                    </p>

                <h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

                <p>
                    We also had some things that we struggled to implement.
                    Most importantly, we experienced issues with our web sockets not sending messages correctly, causing
                    us to ultimately have to dispose the idea.
                    We could have used Pusher, but as that is a paid service we decided to not look into it.

                <h3>Looking back</h3>

                <p>
                    Looking back on this project, I did have fun working together with some of my friends on a Laravel
                    project and being able to share some of my knowledge.
                    There are, however, a few things I would have done different next time around, namely:
                </p>
                <ul style="list-style: disc; padding-left: 1rem;">
                    <li>Push more for a better design, currently it's basically a plain bootstrap site</li>
                    <li>Search an alternative for our web sockets</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Overall, I had fun making this site and I wouldn't mind having to do it again. It took us longer
                    than expected, but we got a working result in the end.
                </p>
